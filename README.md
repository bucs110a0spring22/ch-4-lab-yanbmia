_Replace anything surrounded by the `< >` symbols._

## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?:
  Removed excess code in global space. All code runs from main().
  Saved all values into distinct variable names.
  
Summary of function(s) added:
  -> drawInverseSine(): creates an inverse sine graph (colored blue)
  -> plotPoint(): allows user to add a point to the graph.
  -> intersectionGraph(): checks if the user's point is on the sine graph.
Summary of Feature Added:
  Allows user to change background color, turtle shape, and adding units to the graph. 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
Not sure if this is a bug. But when dart = dart.turtleTurtle() is in main, my code doesn't run. So I just added it to the top of main.py.
